"""
Design a Person class that has all of the immediate attributes of a typical person.

Include fields for name, date of birth, gender, favorite color, height, weight, any anything else you might think of.


The Person class should have the following methods:

An Init which receives a name, gender, date of birth, height, and weight.
Getters and setters for all of the fields.
speak(), which receives an argument containing a string and prints that string out to the screen
scream(), which receives an argument containing a string and prints that string out to the screen in all caps.

---NEXT---
Create a Student class which inherits from person.
The student class should receive the same arguments in its constructors and call the constructor of the Person class giving it those arguments.

The student class should have additional fields for:
The students' major
The students' minor
the students' GPA
The students' year (Freshman, Sophomore, etc)
A classlist of all classes being currently taken

The student class should have getters and setters for all of the fields.
The student class should allow classes to be added individually and removed individually from the classlist itself.
A "clearSchedule()" method should be added that clears all of the classes at one time.
