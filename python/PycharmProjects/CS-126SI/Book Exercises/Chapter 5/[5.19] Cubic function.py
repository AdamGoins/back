"""
Designa  program th solve cubic equations. In your program implement a function cubic_solver(a,b,c,d) that solves the equation,
and returns the roots. Remember a cubic equation has the form ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0

Test code:

print(cubic_solver(1, -6, 11, -6))
print(cubic_solver(-4, 53, -130, 0))
print(cubic_solver(2, 2, 2, 10))

Sample run:
(1, 2, 3)
(10, 8.88e^-16, 3.25)
(-1.88, 0.44 + i* 1.56, 0.44 - i* 1.57)
