"""
Write a program that takes the slope and y intercept of two lines y = mx + b,
finds and displays their point of intersection, or if the lines are parallel, or do not intersect.
Recall the formula for a straight line is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y intercept.

Test code:
print(line_intersection(-.5, 7, 2, 3))
print(line_intersection(3, 4, -2, 3))
print(line_intersection(2, 21, 2, 5))

SAmple run:

(1.6, 6.2)
(-0.2, 3.4)
lines are parallel
