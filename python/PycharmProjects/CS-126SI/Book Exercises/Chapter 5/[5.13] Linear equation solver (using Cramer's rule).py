"""
Write a program that solves systems of equations using Cramer's rule.
REcall Cramer's rule is a method for solving a linear system of equations using determinants where
x = dx / d, y = dy / d, z = dz / d.

Your program only needs to work with two equations in the form ax + by = c.
Define a function that takes the parameters (a1, b2, c1, a2, b2, c2).

Test code:
print(linear_eq_solver(3, -4, 1, 5, 1, 17))
print(linear_eq_solver(-2, 6, 12, 1, -7, 14))
print(linear_eq_solver(4, 5, 2, -1, 5, 3))

Sample run:
(3.0, 2.0)
(-21.0, -5.0)
(-0.2), 0.56)
