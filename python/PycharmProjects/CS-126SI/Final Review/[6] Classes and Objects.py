"""
Write a class that represents a bank account.

The bank account should start with a value of 1000 dollars and allow the user to deposit and withdraw money.
Withdrawls only occur when the amount attempted to be withdrawn is <= the bank total. The withdraw method should return the amount
Attempted to be withdrawn.

Write an equivelance method as well that determines what it means for two bank accounts to be equal.
They should be equal if the money in the account matches eachother exactly.

Write a string method that returns "Account Total:" followed by the total.

Do this using the 4 step problem solving process, and don't forget the UML!
